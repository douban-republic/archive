But for many years now I’ve also had two other great interests: people and history. And today I’m excited to be publishing my first book that builds on these interests. It’s called Idea Makers, and its subtitle is Personal Perspectives on the Lives & Ideas of Some Notable People. It’s based on essays I’ve written over the past decade about a range of people—from ones I’ve personally known (like Richard Feynman and Steve Jobs) to ones who died long before I was born (like Ada Lovelace and Gottfried Leibniz).\nThe book is about lives and ideas, and how they mix together. At its core it’s a book of stories about people, and what those people managed to create. It’s the first book I’ve written that’s fundamentally non-technical—and I’m hoping all sorts of readers without deep technical interests will be able to enjoy it.","price":"USD 22.95"},"book_id":"26832406","id":1064740682},{"status":"read","comment":"喜欢硬科幻的，推荐这本。期待电影或剧。","updated":"2016-06-10 10:04:23","user_id":"1000001","rating":{"max":5,"value":"5","min":0},"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":35,"average":"8.2","min":0},"subtitle":"A Novel","author":["Neal Stephenson"],"pubdate":"2015-5-19","tags":[{"count":93,"name":"科幻","title":"科幻"},{"count":36,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":34,"name":"硬科幻","title":"硬科幻"},{"count":30,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":25,"name":"NealStephenson","title":"NealStephenson"},{"count":22,"name":"科幻/奇幻","title":"科幻/奇幻"},{"count":18,"name":"英文","title":"英文"},{"count":13,"name":"English","title":"English"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s28017430.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"880","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s28017430.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s28017430.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s28017430.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/26335214/","id":"26335214","publisher":"William Morrow","isbn10":"0062190377","isbn13":"9780062190376","title":"Seveneves","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/26335214","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Neal Town Stephenson (born October 31, 1959) is an American writer, known for his speculative fiction works, which have been variously categorized science fiction, historical fiction, maximalism, cyberpunk, and postcyberpunk. Stephenson explores areas such as mathematics, cryptography, philosophy, currency, and the history of science. He also writes non-fiction articles about technology in publications such as Wired Magazine, and has worked part-time as an advisor for Blue Origin, a company (funded by Jeff Bezos) developing a manned sub-orbital launch system.\nBorn in Fort Meade, Maryland (home of the NSA and the National Cryptologic Museum) Stephenson came from a family comprising engineers and hard scientists he dubs \"propeller heads\". His father is a professor of electrical engineering whose father was a physics professor; his mother worked in a biochemistry laboratory, while her father was a biochemistry professor. Stephenson's family moved to Champaign-Urbana, Illinois in 1960 and then to Ames, Iowa in 1966 where he graduated from Ames High School in 1977. Stephenson furthered his studies at Boston University. He first specialized in physics, then switched to geography after he found that it would allow him to spend more time on the university mainframe. He graduated in 1981 with a B.A. in Geography and a minor in physics. Since 1984, Stephenson has lived mostly in the Pacific Northwest and currently resides in Seattle with his family.\nNeal Stephenson is the author of the three-volume historical epic \"The Baroque Cycle\" (Quicksilver, The Confusion, and The System of the World) and the novels Cryptonomicon, The Diamond Age, Snow Crash, and Zodiac. He lives in Seattle, Washington.","summary":"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Anathem, Reamde, and Cryptonomicon comes an exciting and thought-provoking science fiction epic—a grand story of annihilation and survival spanning five thousand years.\nWhat would happen if the world were ending?\nA catastrophic event renders the earth a ticking time bomb. In a feverish race against the inevitable, nations around the globe band together to devise an ambitious plan to ensure the survival of humanity far beyond our atmosphere, in outer space.\nBut the complexities and unpredictability of human nature coupled with unforeseen challenges and dangers threaten the intrepid pioneers, until only a handful of survivors remain . . .\nFive thousand years later, their progeny—seven distinct races now three billion strong—embark on yet another audacious journey into the unknown . . . to an alien world utterly transformed by cataclysm and time: Earth.\nA writer of dazzling genius and imaginative vision, Neal Stephenson combines science, philosophy, technology, psychology, and literature in a magnificent work of speculative fiction that offers a portrait of a future that is both extraordinary and eerily recognizable. As he did in Anathem, Cryptonomicon, the Baroque Cycle, and Reamde, Stephenson explores some of our biggest ideas and perplexing challenges in a breathtaking saga that is daring, engrossing, and altogether brilliant.","price":"USD 35.00"},"book_id":"26335214","id":1050306937},{"status":"read","comment":"谢谢Kim推荐","updated":"2016-02-21 17:58:56","user_id":"1000001","rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":25,"average":"7.9","min":0},"subtitle":"How the Brain's Wiring Makes Us Who We Are","author":["Sebastian Seung"],"pubdate":"2012-2-7","tags":[{"count":26,"name":"神经科学","title":"神经科学"},{"count":18,"name":"neuroscience","title":"neuroscience"},{"count":13,"name":"大脑","title":"大脑"},{"count":11,"name":"认知神经科学","title":"认知神经科学"},{"count":10,"name":"科普","title":"科普"},{"count":9,"name":"脑科学","title":"脑科学"},{"count":9,"name":"思维","title":"思维"},{"count":6,"name":"Brain","title":"Brain"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s7098383.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"384","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s7098383.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s7098383.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s7098383.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/6897158/","id":"6897158","publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","isbn10":"0547508182","isbn13":"9780547508184","title":"Connectome","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/6897158","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 27.00"},"book_id":"6897158","id":1013816442},{"status":"read","comment":"娱乐性挺强的","updated":"2016-02-21 17:57:32","user_id":"1000001","rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":144,"average":"6.1","min":0},"subtitle":"A Memoir","author":["Wednesday Martin Ph.D."],"pubdate":"2015-6-2","tags":[{"count":38,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":36,"name":"女性","title":"女性"},{"count":29,"name":"上东区","title":"上东区"},{"count":28,"name":"纽约","title":"纽约"},{"count":20,"name":"社会人文","title":"社会人文"},{"count":18,"name":"英文","title":"英文"},{"count":18,"name":"育儿","title":"育儿"},{"count":16,"name":"社会学","title":"社会学"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s28100813.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"256","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s28100813.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s28100813.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s28100813.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/26416854/","id":"26416854","publisher":"Simon & Schuster","isbn10":"1476762627","isbn13":"9781476762623","title":"Primates of Park Avenue","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/26416854","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 26.00"},"book_id":"26416854","id":1013815947},{"status":"read","comment":"名言录而已","updated":"2016-02-21 17:56:06","user_id":"1000001","rating":{"max":5,"value":"3","min":0},"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":49,"average":"7.7","min":0},"subtitle":"Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms","author":["Nassim Nicholas Taleb"],"pubdate":"2010-11-30","tags":[{"count":15,"name":"思维","title":"思维"},{"count":13,"name":"哲学","title":"哲学"},{"count":10,"name":"taleb","title":"taleb"},{"count":7,"name":"英文","title":"英文"},{"count":6,"name":"感悟","title":"感悟"},{"count":6,"name":"思想","title":"思想"},{"count":6,"name":"Aphorism","title":"Aphorism"},{"count":3,"name":"美国","title":"美国"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s19899638.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"128","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s19899638.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s19899638.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s19899638.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/5363860/","id":"5363860","publisher":"Random House","isbn10":"1400069971","isbn13":"9781400069972","title":"The Bed of Procrustes","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/5363860","alt_title":"","author_intro":"NASSIM NICHOLAS TALEB is an essayist, belletrist, & researcher only interested in one single topic, chance (particularly extreme & rare events, the \"Black Swans\" i.e. outliers); but it falls at the intersection of philosophy/epistemology (skepticism; knowledge about the dynamics of history; inferential claims), philosophy/ethics (stoicism facing random events; theories of nonhedonic happiness), mathematical sciences (probability theory, statistical physics), social science/finance (opacity & incomplete information in economics), and cognitive science (the mental biases making us \"fooled\" by randomness).

He is noted for his work in the study of happiness and creativity, but is best known as the architect of the notion of flow and for his years of research and writing on the topic. He is the author of many books and over 120 articles or book chapters. Martin Seligman, former president of the American Psychological Association, described Csikszentmihalyi as the world's leading researcher on positive psychology. He once said \"Repression is not the way to virtue. When people restrain themselves out of fear, their lives are by necessity diminished. Only through freely chosen discipline can life be enjoyed and still kept within the bounds of reason.\"  His works are influential and are widely cited.","summary":"You have heard about how a musician loses herself in her music, how a painter becomes one with the process of painting.

The exhaustive case studies, controlled experiments and innumerable references to historical figures, philosophers and scientists through the ages prove Csikszentmihalyi's point that flow is a singularly productive and desirable state.

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled \"quiet,\" it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Gogh’s sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.\nPassionately argued, impressively researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people,  Quiet  shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the reader on a journey from Dale Carnegie’s birthplace to Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the twentieth century and explores its far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of American business culture, where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation, and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and introverts.\nPerhaps most inspiring, she introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Finally, she offers invaluable advice on everything from how to better negotiate differences in introvert-extrovert relationships to how to empower an introverted child to when it makes sense to be a \"pretend extrovert.\"\nThis extraordinary book has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how introverts see themselves.","price":"USD

Today there is just one.\nUs.\nHomo sapiens.\nHow did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come?\nIn Sapiens, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical - and sometimes devastating - breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, palaeontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come?\nBold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future.","price":"GBP 25.00"},"book_id":"25904521","id":1013812644},{"status":"read","comment":"美国精神的代表, 所以副标题是\"an American Life\". 豆瓣App下看完书的第一个评分.

He explores the wit behind  Poor Richard's Almanac  and the wisdom behind the Declaration of Independence, the new nation's alliance with France, the treaty that ended the Revolution, and the compromises that created a near-perfect Constitution. Above all, Isaacson shows how Franklin's unwavering faith in the wisdom of the common citizen and his instinctive appreciation for the possibilities of democracy helped to forge an American national identity based on the virtues and values of its middle class.","price":"USD 19.99"},"book_id":"1365773","id":862133022},{"status":"read","comment":"值得一读，虽然戏剧化得稍过了一点点。","updated":"2014-04-27 14:46:55","user_id":"1000001","tags":["创业","商业","管理"],"rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":174,"average":"8.2","min":0},"subtitle":"A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship, and Betrayal","author":["Nick Bilton"],"pubdate":"2013-11-5","tags":[{"count":86,"name":"Twitter","title":"Twitter"},{"count":77,"name":"互联网","title":"互联网"},{"count":71,"name":"创业","title":"创业"},{"count":57,"name":"传记","title":"传记"},{"count":51,"name":"商业","title":"商业"},{"count":41,"name":"科技","title":"科技"},{"count":29,"name":"管理","title":"管理"},{"count":23,"name":"美国","title":"美国"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s27086329.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"304","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s27086329.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s27086329.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s27086329.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/24661633/","id":"24661633","publisher":"Portfolio Hardcover","isbn10":"1591846013","isbn13":"9781591846017","title":"Hatching Twitter","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/24661633","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Nick Bilton is a columnist and reporter for The New York Times, where he explores the disruptive aspects of technology on business, culture and society.

He lives in Los Angeles.","summary":"The dramatic, unlikely story behind the founding of Twitter, by New York Times bestselling author and Vanity Fair special correspondent\nThe San Francisco-based technology company Twitter has become a powerful force in less than ten years. Today it’s everything from a tool for fighting political oppression in the Middle East to a marketing must-have to the world’s living room during live TV events to President Trump’s preferred method of communication. It has hundreds of millions of active users all over the world.\nBut few people know that it nearly fell to pieces early on.\nIn this rousing history that reads like a novel, Hatching Twitter takes readers behind the scenes of Twitter’s early exponential growth, following the four hackers—Ev Williams, Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass, who created the cultural juggernaut practically by accident.  It’s a drama of betrayed friendships and high-stakes power struggles over money, influence, and control over a company that was growing faster than they could ever imagine.\nDrawing on hundreds of sources, documents, and internal e-mails, Bilton offers a rarely-seen glimpse of the inner workings of technology startups, venture capital, and Silicon Valley culture.\nAmazon.com Review\nAn Amazon Best Book of the Month, November 2013: Spoiler alert: The subtitle sorta says it all. That is, Nick Bilton's Hatching Twitter delivers \"A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship, and Betrayal,\" though not necessarily in that order. The book's four central players--Ev, Jack, Biz, and Noah--conceived of Twitter while working on Odeo, an ultimately doomed attempt to revolutionize podcasting. As their little chick grew, the four men's personal and ideological differences led to a power struggle that eventually left them all on the sidelines as a former stand-up comedian took Twitter into the uncertain future. Writing with the pacing and veracity of detail of a true-crime book, Bilton makes use of a trove of source material--from internal Twitter e-mails to extensive interviews with and early tweets by the founders themselves--and the result is as exciting and fast-paced as it is topically relevant. If you're looking for a thoughtful rumination about Twitter as a revolutionary global communications platform, keep looking. If you're looking for a quick, well-written, thoroughly researched human drama, the story of an utterly dysfunctional foursome and the accelerated unraveling of their once brilliant partnership, this is your book. #HighlyRecommended. --Jason Kirk (@brasswax)\nReview\n\"A fast-paced and perceptive new book by Nick Bilton.\" -- The New York Times\n\"Extensively detailed... unexpectedly addictive.\"  -- The Wall Street Journal\n\"Deeply reported and deliciously written.\" -- The Verge\n\"A compelling read, more like espionage than a corporate history.\" -- Fortune Magazine\n\"A dramatic and detail-rich recounting.\" -- Cnet\n\"Fast-paced... a perceptive read.\" -- USA Today\n\"Goes where no book has gone before.\" -- The Huffington Post\n\"Unputdownable.\" -- Wall Street Journal Columnist","price":"USD 28.95"},"book_id":"24661633","id":800867660},{"status":"read","comment":"You'll love it,  or you'll be bored to death.

For what Taleb calls the “antifragile” is actually beyond the robust, because it benefits from shocks, uncertainty, and stressors, just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension. The antifragile needs disorder in order to survive and flourish.\n\nTaleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, even necessary, and proposes that things be built in an antifragile manner. The antifragile is immune to prediction errors. Why is the city-state better than the nation-state, why is debt bad for you, and why is everything that is both modern and complicated bound to fail? The book spans innovation by trial and error, health, biology, medicine, life decisions, politics, foreign policy, urban planning, war, personal finance, and economic systems. And throughout, in addition to the street wisdom of Fat Tony of Brooklyn, the voices and recipes of ancient wisdom, from Roman, Greek, Semitic, and medieval sources, are heard loud and clear.\n\nExtremely ambitious and multidisciplinary, Antifragile provides a blueprint for how to behave—and thrive—in a world we don't understand, and which is too uncertain for us to even try to understand and predict. Erudite and witty, Taleb’s message is revolutionary: What is not antifragile will surely perish.","price":"USD 30.00"},"book_id":"10545758","id":622961423},{"status":"read","comment":"才知道Michael Crichton已经挂了。可惜。这本如果是他单人写完的话，可能悬念会更意外惊喜一点。","updated":"2011-12-22 16:21:36","user_id":"1000001","tags":["科幻"],"rating":{"max":5,"value":"3","min":0},"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":14,"average":"7.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Novel","author":["Michael Crichton","Richard Preston"],"pubdate":"2011-11-22","tags":[{"count":5,"name":"科幻","title":"科幻"},{"count":3,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":2,"name":"英语","title":"英语"},{"count":1,"name":"michaelcrichton","title":"michaelcrichton"},{"count":1,"name":"English_Edition","title":"English_Edition"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s7004628.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"429","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s7004628.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s7004628.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s7004628.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/4445111/","id":"4445111","publisher":"Harper","isbn10":"0060873027","isbn13":"9780060873028","title":"Micro","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/4445111","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"An instant classic in the vein of Jurassic Park, this boundary-pushing novel has all the hallmarks of Michael Crichton's greatest adventures with its combination of pulse-pounding thrills, cutting-edge technology, and extraordinary research  Three men are found dead in a locked second-floor office in Honolulu. There is no sign of struggle, though their bodies are covered in ultra-fine, razor-sharp cuts. With no evidence, the police dismiss it as a bizarre suicide pact. But the murder weapon is still in the room, almost invisible to the human eye.  In Cambridge, Massachusetts, seven graduate students at the forefront of their fields are recruited by a pioneering microbiology start-up company. Nanigen MicroTechnologies sends them to a mysterious laboratory in Hawaii, where they are promised access to tools that will open up a whole new scientific frontier.  But this opportunity of a lifetime will teach them the true cost of existing at the cutting-edge!  The group becomes prey to a technology of radical, unimaginable power and is thrust out into the teeming rainforest. Armed only with their knowledge of the natural world, the young scientists face a hostile wilderness that threatens danger at every turn.

He lives in Colorado with his wife.","summary":"\"Is Google making us stupid?\" When Nicholas Carr posed that question, in a celebrated Atlantic Monthly cover story, he tapped into a well of anxiety about how the Internet is changing us. He also crystallized one of the most important debates of our time: As we enjoy the Net's bounties, are we sacrificing our ability to read and think deeply? Now, Carr expands his argument into the most compelling exploration of the Internet's intellectual and cultural consequences yet published. As he describes how human thought has been shaped through the centuries by \"tools of the mind\"--from the alphabet to maps, to the printing press, the clock, and the computer--Carr interweaves a fascinating account of recent discoveries in neuroscience by such pioneers as Michael Merzenich and Eric Kandel. Our brains, the historical and scientific evidence reveals, change in response to our experiences. The technologies we use to find, store, and share information can literally reroute our neural pathways. Building on the insights of thinkers from Plato to McLuhan, Carr makes a convincing case that every information technology carries an intellectual ethic--a set of assumptions about the nature of knowledge and intelligence. He explains how the printed book served to focus our attention, promoting deep and creative thought. In stark contrast, the Internet encourages the rapid, distracted sampling of small bits of information from many sources. Its ethic is that of the industrialist, an ethic of speed and efficiency, of optimized production and consumption--and now the Net is remaking us in its own image. We are becoming ever more adept at scanning and skimming, but what we are losing is our capacity for concentration, contemplation, and reflection. Part intellectual history, part popular science, and part cultural criticism, The Shallows sparkles with memorable vignettes--Friedrich Nietzsche wrestling with a typewriter, Sigmund Freud dissecting the brains of sea creatures, Nathaniel Hawthorne contemplating the thunderous approach of a steam locomotive--even as it plumbs profound questions about the state of our modern psyche. This is a book that will forever alter the way we think about media and our minds.","price":"USD 26.95"},"book_id":"4096693","id":270770325},{"status":"read","comment":"via Jean","updated":"2010-06-29 19:06:16","user_id":"1000001","tags":["金融","经济"],"rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":611,"average":"8.6","min":0},"subtitle":"The Inside Story of How Wall Street and Washington Fought to Save the Financial System---and Themselves","author":["Andrew Ross Sorkin"],"pubdate":"2009-10-20","tags":[{"count":313,"name":"金融","title":"金融"},{"count":243,"name":"金融危机","title":"金融危机"},{"count":187,"name":"华尔街","title":"华尔街"},{"count":132,"name":"经济","title":"经济"},{"count":117,"name":"finance","title":"finance"},{"count":80,"name":"经济学","title":"经济学"},{"count":65,"name":"economics","title":"economics"},{"count":62,"name":"历史","title":"历史"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s4250780.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"624","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s4250780.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s4250780.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s4250780.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/4069561/","id":"4069561","publisher":"Viking Adult","isbn10":"0670021253","isbn13":"9780670021253","title":"Too Big to Fail","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/4069561","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Andrew Ross Sorkin is the award-winning chief mergers and acquisitions reporter for The New York Times, a columnist, and assistant editor of business and finance news.

From inside the corner office at Lehman Brothers to secret meetings in South Korea, and the corridors of Washington, Too Big to Fail is the definitive story of the most powerful men and women in finance and politics grappling with success and failure, ego and greed, and, ultimately, the fate of the world’s economy.\n“We’ve got to get some foam down on the runway!” a sleepless Timothy Geithner, the then-president of the Federal Reserve of New York, would tell Henry M. Paulson, the Treasury secretary, about the catastrophic crash the world’s financial system would experience.\nThrough unprecedented access to the players involved, Too Big to Fail re-creates all the drama and turmoil, revealing never disclosed details and elucidating how decisions made on Wall Street over the past decade sowed the seeds of the debacle. This true story is not just a look at banks that were “too big to fail,” it is a real-life thriller with a cast of bold-faced names who themselves thought they were too big to fail.","price":"USD 32.95"},"book_id":"4069561","id":224120245},{"status":"read","comment":"在iBooks上买的第二本书。","updated":"2010-04-27 21:14:37","user_id":"1000001","tags":["科幻"],"rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":8,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Watch","author":["Robert J.

His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life.\n   In his internationally bestselling, now classic volume,  The Selfish Gene , Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene.  The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature.  Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk.\n   This 30th anniversary edition of Dawkins' fascinating book retains all original material, including the two enlightening chapters added in the second edition. In a new Introduction the author presents his thoughts thirty years after the publication of his first and most famous book, while the inclusion of the two-page original Foreword by brilliant American scientist Robert Trivers shows the enthusiastic reaction of the scientific community at that time. This edition is a celebration of a remarkable exposition of evolutionary thought, a work that has been widely hailed for its stylistic brilliance and deep scientific insights, and that continues to stimulate whole new areas of research today.","price":"USD 19.95"},"book_id":"1777630","id":185092241},{"status":"read","rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"updated":"2009-09-21 17:23:17","user_id":"1000001","tags":["设计","城市规划"],"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":51,"average":"8.8","min":0},"subtitle":"Urban Patterns and Meanings Through History","author":["Spiro Kostof"],"pubdate":"1993-05-04","tags":[{"count":54,"name":"城市","title":"城市"},{"count":39,"name":"城市设计","title":"城市设计"},{"count":29,"name":"城市规划","title":"城市规划"},{"count":22,"name":"建筑","title":"建筑"},{"count":18,"name":"历史","title":"历史"},{"count":13,"name":"urban_design","title":"urban_design"},{"count":11,"name":"city+history","title":"city+history"},{"count":9,"name":"architecture","title":"architecture"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s2333881.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"352","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s2333881.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s2333881.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s2333881.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/1370957/","id":"1370957","publisher":"Bulfinch","isbn10":"0821220160","isbn13":"9780821220160","title":"The City Shaped","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/1370957","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Spanning the ages and the globe, Spiro Kostof explores the city as a repository of cultural meaning and an embodiment of the community it shelters.

With the click of a computer mouse we can find exact directions to just about anywhere on earth, and with a handheld GPS we can find our precise latitude and longitude, even in the remotest of places. But despite all our advancements, we still get lost in the mall, can’t follow directions to a friend’s house and, on camping expeditions, take wrong turns that can mean the difference between life and death.\nMany other species, however, have an innate sense of direction. Ants display surprisingly sophisticated behavior, traveling great distances without wasting a step. Monarch butterflies and migrating songbirds pilot even greater expanses, thousands of kilometers in some instances, to targets that they might never even have seen before. A homing pigeon can be driven halfway across a continent in a lightproof box and then, on release, find its way—unerringly—back to its loft. What is truly amazing, though, is that humans, the only animal that has come close to understanding how some of these magnificent navigational feats are performed, are rendered helpless by dense bush or even an unexpected turn in a maze of cubicles.\nIn You Are Here, psychologist Colin Ellard explains how, over centuries of innovation, we have lost our instinctive ability to find our way, as we traverse vast distances in mere hours in luxurious comfort. Some cultures, such as the Inuit, retain the ability to navigate huge expanses of seemingly empty space, as their survival depends on it, but the rest of us have been so conditioned by our built-up world that we don’t really know how to get from point A to point B.\nDrawing on his exhaustive research, Ellard illuminates this disconnect from our world with great clarity and explains what it means, not just for our forays into the wilderness but for how we construct our cities, our workplaces, and even our homes and virtual worlds. Architects and city planners, he suggests, need to consider human behavior when designing human environments, and we all need to recognize that we are part of, not isolated from, the space around us.","price":"$ 25.00"},"book_id":"3841622","id":138528571},{"status":"read","rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"updated":"2009-07-08 18:27:29","user_id":"1000001","tags":["文化"],"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":354,"average":"9.3","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Italo Calvino"],"pubdate":"1978-5-3","tags":[{"count":73,"name":"卡尔维诺","title":"卡尔维诺"},{"count":63,"name":"ItaloCalvino","title":"ItaloCalvino"},{"count":58,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":53,"name":"意大利","title":"意大利"},{"count":38,"name":"文学","title":"文学"},{"count":30,"name":"建筑","title":"建筑"},{"count":30,"name":"Literature","title":"Literature"},{"count":25,"name":"散文","title":"散文"}],"origin_title":"Le Città Invisibili","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s28312764.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":["William Weaver"],"catalog":"## Chapter 1\nCities & Memory 1\nCities & Memory 2\nCities & Desire 1\nCities & Memory 3\nCities & Desire 2\nCities & Signs 1\nCities & Memory 4\nCities & Desire 3\nCities & Signs 2\nThin Cities 1\n## Chapter 2\nCities & Memory 5\nCities & Desire 4\nCities & Signs 3\nThin Cities 2\nTrading Cities 1\n## Chapter 3\nCities & Desire 5\nCities & Signs 4\nThin Cities 3\nTrading Cities 2\nCities & Eyes 1\n## Chapter 4\nCities & Signs 5\nThin Cities 4\nTrading Cities 3\nCities & Eyes 2\nCities & Names 1\n## Chapter 5\nThin Cities 5\nTrading Cities 4\nCities & Eyes 3\nCities & Names 2\nCities & the Dead 1\n## Chapter 6\nTrading Cities 5\nCities & Eyes 4\nCities & Names 3\nCities & the Dead 2\nCities & the Sky 1\n## Chapter 7\nCities & Eyes 5\nCities & Names 4\nCities & the Dead 3\nCities & the Sky 2\nContinous Cities 1\n## Chapter 8\nCities & Names 5\nCities & the Dead 4\nCities & the Sky 3\nContinous Cities 2\nHidden Cities 1\n## Chapter 9\nCities & the Dead 5\nCities & the Sky 4\nContinous Cities 3\nHidden Cities 2\nCities & the Sky 5\nContinous Cities 4\nHidden Cities 3\nContinous Cities 5\nHidden Cities 4\nHidden Cities 5","pages":"165","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s28312764.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s28312764.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s28312764.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/1456407/","id":"1456407","publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","isbn10":"0156453800","isbn13":"9780156453806","title":"Invisible Cities","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/1456407","alt_title":"Le Città Invisibili","author_intro":"Italo Calvino was a writer and journalist.

For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.\nWhy do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities.\nWe concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”\nFor years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now, in this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don’t know. He offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.\nElegant, startling, and universal in its applications The Black Swan will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory.\nThe Black Swan is a landmark book – itself a black swan.\nThe book also contains a 4-page glossary; 19 pages of notes; and, a 28-page bibliography in addition to an index.","price":"USD 30.00"},"book_id":"2072159","id":115106464},{"status":"read","rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"updated":"2009-02-01 10:56:05","user_id":"1000001","tags":["经济"],"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":79,"average":"8.4","min":0},"subtitle":"Exposing Why the Rich Are Rich, the Poor Are Poor--and Why You Can Never Buy a Decent Used Car!","author":["Tim Harford"],"pubdate":"2005-11-1","tags":[{"count":43,"name":"经济学","title":"经济学"},{"count":36,"name":"economics","title":"economics"},{"count":14,"name":"经济","title":"经济"},{"count":10,"name":"原版","title":"原版"},{"count":6,"name":"finance","title":"finance"},{"count":5,"name":"科普","title":"科普"},{"count":5,"name":"哈福德","title":"哈福德"},{"count":4,"name":"economy","title":"economy"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s4385101.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s4385101.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s4385101.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s4385101.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/1479360/","id":"1479360","publisher":"Oxford University Press","isbn10":"0195189779","isbn13":"9780195189773","title":"The Undercover Economist","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/1479360","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"An economist's version of The Way Things Work, this engaging volume is part field guide to economics and part expose of the economic principles lurking behind daily events, explaining everything from traffic jams to high coffee prices.  The Undercover Economist is for anyone who's wondered why the gap between rich and poor nations is so great, or why they can't seem to find a decent second-hand car, or how to outwit Starbucks. This book offers the hidden story behind these and other questions, as economist Tim Harford ranges from Africa, Asia, Europe, and of course the United States to reveal how supermarkets, airlines, and coffee chains--to name just a few--are vacuuming money from our wallets. Harford punctures the myths surrounding some of today's biggest controversies, including the high cost of health-care; he reveals why certain environmental laws can put a smile on a landlord's face; and he explains why some industries can have high profits for innocent reasons, while in other industries something sinister is going on. Covering an array of economic concepts including scarce resources, market power, efficiency, price gouging, market failure, inside information, and game theory, Harford sheds light on how these forces shape our day-to-day lives, often without our knowing it.  Showing us the world through the eyes of an economist, Tim Harford reveals that everyday events are intricate games of negotiations, contests of strength, and battles of wits. Written with a light touch and sly wit, The Undercover Economist turns \"the dismal science\" into a true delight.","price":"CAD 28.95"},"book_id":"1479360","id":92469107},{"status":"read","comment":"和Spin相比差不少","updated":"2008-09-16 11:19:55","user_id":"1000001","tags":["科幻"],"rating":{"max":5,"value":"3","min":0},"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":7,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Robert Charles Wilson"],"pubdate":"2008-06-03","tags":[{"count":4,"name":"科幻","title":"科幻"},{"count":3,"name":"科幻小说","title":"科幻小说"},{"count":2,"name":"英文","title":"英文"},{"count":2,"name":"RobertWilson","title":"RobertWilson"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s4249916.jpg","binding":"Mass Market Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"368","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s4249916.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s4249916.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s4249916.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/3127420/","id":"3127420","publisher":"Tor Books","isbn10":"0765348268","isbn13":"9780765348265","title":"Axis","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/3127420","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Wildly praised by readers and critics alike, Robert Charles Wilson's \"Spin\" won science fiction's highest honor, the Hugo Award for Best Novel.

Humans are colonizing this new world--and, predictably, fiercely exploiting its resources, chiefly large deposits of oil in the western deserts of the continent of Equatoria. Lise Adams is a young woman attempting to uncover the mystery of her father's disappearance ten years earlier. Turk Findley is an ex-sailor and sometimes-drifter.

How can you filter streams of complex information to pull out only what you want? Why does it matter how information is structured when Google seems to magically bring up the right answer to your questions? What does it mean to be \"findable\" in this day and age?  This eye-opening new book examines the convergence of information and connectivity. Written by Peter Morville, author of the groundbreaking Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, the book defines our current age as a state of unlimited findability. In other words, anyone can find anything at any time. Complete navigability.   \n\n  Morville discusses the Internet, GIS, and other network technologies that are coming together to make unlimited findability possible. He explores how the melding of these innovations impacts society, since Web access is now a standard requirement for successful people and businesses. But before he does that, Morville looks back at the history of wayfinding and human evolution, suggesting that our fear of being lost has driven us to create maps, charts, and now, the mobile Internet.</p>  \n\n  The book's central thesis is that information literacy, information architecture, and usability are all critical components of this new world order. Hand in hand with that is the contention that only by planning and designing the best possible software, devices, and Internet, will we be able to maintain this connectivity in the future. Morville's book is highlighted with full color illustrations and rich examples that bring his prose to life.</p>  \n\n  Ambient Findability doesn't preach or pretend to know all the answers. Instead, it presents research, stories, and examples in support of its novel ideas. Are we truly at a critical point in our evolution where the quality of our digital networks will dictate how we behave as a species? Is findability indeed the primary key to a successful global marketplace in the 21st century and beyond. Peter Morville takes you on a thought-provoking tour of these memes and more -- ideas that will not only fascinate but will stir your creativity in practical ways that you can apply to your work immediately.</p>  \n\n  \"A lively, enjoyable and informative tour of a topic that's only going to become more important.\"\n  --David Weinberger, Author, Small Pieces Loosely Joined and The Cluetrain Manifesto</br></p>  \n\n  \"I envy the young scholar who finds this inventive book, by whatever strange means are necessary. The future isn't just unwritten--it's unsearched.\"\n  --Bruce Sterling, Writer, Futurist, and Co-Founder, The Electronic Frontier Foundation</br></p>  \n\n  \"Search engine marketing is the hottest thing in Internet business, and deservedly so. Ambient Findability puts SEM into a broader context and provides deeper insights into human behavior. This book will help you grow your online business in a world where being found is not at all certain.\"\n  --Jakob Nielsen, Ph.D., Author, Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity</br></p>  \n\n  \"Information that's hard to find will remain information that's hardly found--from one of the fathers of the discipline of information architecture, and one of its most experienced practitioners, come penetrating observations on why findability is elusive and how the act of seeking changes us.\"\n  --Steve Papa, Founder and Chairman, Endeca</br></p>  \n\n  \"Whether it's a fact or a figure, a person or a place, Peter Morville knows how to make it findable. Morville explores the possibilities of a world where everything can always be found--and the challenges in getting there--in this wide-ranging, thought-provoking book.\"\n  --Jesse James Garrett, Author, The Elements of User Experience</br></p>  \n\n  \"It is easy to assume that current searching of the World Wide Web is the last word in finding and using information. Peter Morville shows us that search engines are just the beginning. Skillfully weaving together information science research with his own extensive experience, he develops for the reader a feeling for the near future when information is truly findable all around us. There are immense implications, and Morville's lively and humorous writing brings them home.\"\n  --Marcia J. Bates, Ph.D., University of California Los Angeles</br></p>  \n\n  \"I've always known that Peter Morville was smart.

They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier. He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout. It would shape their lives. The effect is worldwide. The sun is now a featureless disk--a heat source, rather than an astronomical object. The moon is gone, but tides remain. Not only have the world's artificial satellites fallen out of orbit, their recovered remains are pitted and aged, as though they'd been in space far longer than their known lifespans. As Tyler, Jason, and Diane grow up, a space probe reveals a bizarre truth: The barrier is artificial, generated by huge alien artifacts. Time is passing faster outside the barrier than inside--more than a hundred million years per year on Earth. At this rate, the death throes of the sun are only about forty years in our future. Jason, now a promising young scientist, devotes his life to working against this slow-moving apocalypse. Diane throws herself into hedonism, marrying a sinister cult leader who's forged a new religion out of the fears of the masses. Earth sends terraforming machines to Mars to let the onrush of time do its work, turning the planet green. Next they send humans...and immediately get back an emissary with thousands of years of stories to tell about the settling of Mars. Then Earth's probes reveal that an identical barrier has appeared around Mars. Jason, desperate, seeds near space with self-replicating machines that will scatter copies of themselves outward from the sun--and report back on what they find. Life on Earth is about to get much, much stranger.","price":"USD 7.99"},"book_id":"1993294","id":32177324},{"status":"read","rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"updated":"2008-05-24 14:15:55","user_id":"1000001","tags":["小说"],"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":7736,"average":"7.9","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["张北海"],"pubdate":"2007-5-1","tags":[{"count":1527,"name":"张北海","title":"张北海"},{"count":1434,"name":"老北京","title":"老北京"},{"count":1247,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1120,"name":"武侠","title":"武侠"},{"count":774,"name":"江湖","title":"江湖"},{"count":728,"name":"民国","title":"民国"},{"count":598,"name":"侠隐","title":"侠隐"},{"count":571,"name":"北京","title":"北京"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s2542876.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":[],"catalog":"1.前门东站\n2.巧红\n3.蓝公馆\n4.燕京画报\n5.八月节\n6.蓝兰的舞会\n7.小跨院\n8.圆明园废墟\n9.夜店\n10.无觅处\n11.长城试枪\n12.一宇洋行\n13.火烧仓库\n14.卓府堂会\n15.羽田宅\n16.掌毙羽田\n17.燕子李三\n18.什刹海\n19.盗剑\n20.香槟鱼子酱\n21.冬至\n22.访客\n23.蓝氏兄妹\n24.卓十一\n25.查户口\n26.腊八\n27.东宫\n28.顺天府\n29.春节\n30.春饼\n31.卓府留帖\n32.断臂\n33.午夜的承诺\n34.绑架\n35.五月节\n36.事变卢沟桥\n37.围城\n38.东站送别\n39.第一件任务\n40.第二件任务\n41.血溅顺天府\n42.夕阳无语","pages":"413","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s2542876.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s2542876.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s2542876.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/2079345/","id":"2079345","publisher":"上海人民出版社","isbn10":"7208069050","isbn13":"9787208069053","title":"侠隐","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/2079345","alt_title":"","author_intro":"张北海，本名张文艺，祖籍山西五台，1936年生于北京，1949年随家人移居台湾，师从叶嘉莹学习中文，就读于台湾师范大学，1962年到洛杉矶继续深造，1972年因工作迁往纽约，定居至今。主要著作有散文集《一瓢纽约》、“美国三部曲”以及小说《侠隐》。\n1970年代起，张北海的家成了初抵纽约的华人了解这座城市的必到之地。阿城、陈丹青、张大春、王安忆、李安、张艾嘉、罗大佑、李宗盛、陈升等人，都是从他的客厅里认识纽约的。《一瓢纽约》即为他多年纽约生活所得。\n1990年代，从联合国退休后，张北海转而虚构《侠隐》，写尽出生地老北京的无限风情。文笔老道，笔下风流，既透露出他骨子里的中国气质，又显示出十足的洋派作风。","summary":"姜文最新电影《邪不压正》原著小说；阿城、王安忆、王德威、陈丹青、张大春、骆以军倾城推荐；民国初年的侠义故事，在文字中复活的北平繁华顶点。\n\n小说《侠隐》被称为“老北京的哀悼之作”。小说对老北京的描写细节精确，味道醇厚，所虚构的武侠故事真实可信，阿城先生赞道具有“贴骨到肉的质感”“果然好看”。张北海笔下的北京，是一个“有钱人的天堂，老百姓的清平世界”，传统和现代，市井和江湖，最中国的和最西洋的，最平常的和最传奇的，融为一炉，它透过今日开放社会的眼光去回望传统，发现其中的美好，并创造一个理想的城市。真正的老北京已经消失，而张北海却用文字使它复活，使它栩栩如生。\n---------------------------------------------\n《侠隐》故事背景发生在民国时期的北京，当时日本尚未入侵，北平鱼龙混杂。青年侠士李天然，为寻找五年前师门血案的元凶，深入古都的胡同巷陌。随着他调查的深入，京城各路人马的斗智斗狠浮出水面，日本特务、亲日分子、豪门旧户、黑帮老大、交际花、外国记者等轮番上阵。而老百姓的日子依旧悠悠然地过着。庙会、堂会依循旧例；东城、西城一如往日。人情冷暖、旧京风华扑面而来。然而卢沟桥一声枪响，北平淹没在战争烟尘中。\n-----------------------------------------------\n《侠隐》开篇而且通篇即在我很熟悉的北京，细节精确，我甚至可以为有兴趣的读者作导游……国际、国家、民间的复杂关系令人惊异，其中个人武功能力展现得又合理又不可思议，是那种贴骨到肉的质感，不涉此前武侠小说一目十行的陈词。果然好看。\n——阿城\n张北海所依赖的，不是悼亡伤逝的情绪，而是文字的再现力量。他是在跨越时空的睽违，观看北京当年的回光返照。除了怀旧，他更要创造他的理想城市。\n——王德威\n张北海的《侠隐》，就是写了一个人世间的侠士。\n——王安忆\n皮影戏般的飞侠、戏台上的爱情对白，乃至大型战争场景的动员及历史幻景，全在不忍删除的细微末节知识掌故中，边界模糊而让人相信“在1937年的北京城里，真的曾经存在过那样一座城市”。\n——骆以军\n《侠隐》以久违了的扎实的笔触与沉稳的心迹、干净的文字和严谨老道的叙事方式，特别是意在笔先，认真做足了功课，稔熟于心地融入了大量的老北京地理和民俗民风，真的是地道，写得那样韵味醇厚，精描细刻，逸笔氤氲，宛若一帧墨渍淋漓的水墨画。方才让一册小说写得如此蕴藉，让一座京城舒展得如此丰厚，耐得住咀嚼和回味。\n——肖复兴","series":{"id":"14345","title":"华语文学系列"},"price":"26.00元"},"book_id":"2079345","id":32893391},{"status":"read","comment":"蜻蜓点水","updated":"2008-05-24 14:15:18","user_id":"1000001","tags":["商业","复杂系统"],"rating":{"max":5,"value":"3","min":0},"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":16,"average":"7.8","min":0},"subtitle":"The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations","author":["Ori Brafman","Rod A.

But if you cut off a starfish's leg it grows a new one, and the old leg can grow into an entirely new starfish.     What's the hidden power behind the success of Wikipedia, craigslist, and Skype? What do eBay and General Electric have in common with the abolitionist and women's rights movements? What fundamental choice put General Motors and Toyota on vastly different paths? How could winning a Supreme Court case be the biggest mistake MGM could have made?     After five years of ground-breaking research, Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom share some unexpected answers, gripping stories, and a tapestry of unlikely connections.  The Starfish and the Spider  argues that organizations fall into two categories: traditional \"spiders,\" which have a rigid hierarchy and top-down leadership, and revolutionary \"starfish,\" which rely on the power of peer relationships.      The Starfish and the Spider  explores what happens when starfish take on spiders (such as the music industry vs. Napster, Kazaa, and the P2P services that followed). It reveals how established companies and institutions, from IBM to Intuit to the US government, are also learning how to incorporate starfish principles to achieve success. The book explores:   * How the Apaches fended off the powerful Spanish army for 200 years\n  * The power of a simple circle\n  * The importance of catalysts who have an uncanny ability to bring people together \n  * How the Internet has become a breeding ground for leaderless organizations\n  * How Alcoholics Anonymous has reached untold millions with only a shared ideology and without a leader\n  \n   The Starfish and the Spider  is the rare book that will change how you understand the world around you.","price":"USD 24.95"},"book_id":"1918678","id":41519568},{"status":"read","rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"updated":"2008-02-05 20:39:50","user_id":"1000001","tags":["人类学","文化"],"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":29,"average":"7.3","min":0},"subtitle":"From Dating, Shopping, and Praying to Going to War and Becoming a Billionaire-- Two Evolutionary Psychologists Explain Why We Do What We Do","author":["Alan S.

From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none.\n\nLosing My Virginity is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business, he and his friends decided that \"since we're complete virgins at business, let's call it just that: Virgin.\" Since then, Branson has written his own \"rules\" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy.\n\nMany of Richard Branson's companies--airlines, retailing, and cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said, \"Don't do it.\" But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. \nAnd in this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in Branson's life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories:\n\n Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globe\n\nSigning the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil Collins\n\nFighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishment\n\nSwimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of Mexico\n\nSelling Virgin Records to save Virgin Atlantic\n\nStaging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War . . .\n\nAnd much more. Losing My Virginity is the ultimate tale of personal and business survival from a man who combines the business prowess of Bill Gates and the promotional instincts of P. T. Barnum.\n\n Also available in the UK from Virgin Publishing, and in Canada from General Publishing, \n\n From the Hardcover edition.","price":"USD 16.00"},"book_id":"1763398","id":26256990},{"status":"read","updated":"2007-12-16 12:35:34","user_id":"1000001","tags":["复杂系统"],"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":75,"average":"7.4","min":0},"subtitle":"Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few and How Collective Wisdom Shapes Business","author":["James Surowiecki"],"pubdate":"2005-8-16","tags":[{"count":49,"name":"心理学","title":"心理学"},{"count":40,"name":"群体智慧","title":"群体智慧"},{"count":39,"name":"社会","title":"社会"},{"count":24,"name":"社会学","title":"社会学"},{"count":20,"name":"管理","title":"管理"},{"count":18,"name":"wisdom","title":"wisdom"},{"count":15,"name":"Psychology","title":"Psychology"},{"count":13,"name":"web2.0","title":"web2.0"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s2718917.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"336","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s2718917.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s2718917.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s2718917.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/1479542/","id":"1479542","publisher":"Anchor","isbn10":"0385721706","isbn13":"9780385721707","title":"The Wisdom of Crowds","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/1479542","alt_title":"群体的智慧（中信出版）","author_intro":"","summary":"In this fascinating book,  New Yorker  business columnist James Surowiecki explores a deceptively simple idea: Large groups of people are  smarter  than an elite few, no matter how brilliant–better at solving problems, fostering innovation, coming to wise decisions, even predicting the future. \n\nWith boundless erudition and in delightfully clear prose, Surowiecki ranges across fields as diverse as popular culture, psychology, ant biology, behavioral economics, artificial intelligence, military history, and politics to show how this simple idea offers important lessons for how we live our lives, select our leaders, run our companies, and think about our world.","price":"GBP 10.20"},"book_id":"1479542","id":26340167},{"status":"read","rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"updated":"2007-11-21 01:06:20","user_id":"1000001","tags":["管理"],"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":269,"average":"8.6","min":0},"subtitle":"Stories of Startups' Early Days","author":["Jessica Livingston"],"pubdate":"2007-01-22","tags":[{"count":410,"name":"创业","title":"创业"},{"count":230,"name":"startup","title":"startup"},{"count":128,"name":"商业","title":"商业"},{"count":118,"name":"IT","title":"IT"},{"count":107,"name":"传记","title":"传记"},{"count":103,"name":"管理","title":"管理"},{"count":95,"name":"entrepreneurship","title":"entrepreneurship"},{"count":68,"name":"Business","title":"Business"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s1994753.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"500","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s1994753.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s1994753.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s1994753.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/1966719/","id":"1966719","publisher":"Apress","isbn10":"1590597141","isbn13":"9781590597149","title":"Founders at Work","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/1966719","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Jessica Livingston is a founding partner at Y Combinator, a seed-stage venture firm based in Cambridge, MA, and Mountain View, CA.

She has a BA in English from Bucknell.","summary":"Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days is a collection of interviews with founders of famous technology companies about what happened in the very earliest days. These people are celebrities now. What was it like when they were just a couple friends with an idea? Founders like Steve Wozniak (Apple), Caterina Fake (Flickr), Mitch Kapor (Lotus), Max Levchin (PayPal), and Sabeer Bhatia (Hotmail) tell you in their own words about their surprising and often very funny discoveries as they learned how to build a company.\nWhere did they get the ideas that made them rich? How did they convince investors to back them? What went wrong, and how did they recover?\nNearly all technical people have thought of one day starting or working for a startup. For them, this book is the closest you can come to being a fly on the wall at a successful startup, to learn how it's done.\nBut ultimately these interviews are required reading for anyone who wants to understand business, because startups are business reduced to its essence.

If each person makes choices for personal (and often irrational) reasons, how can people's choices be predicted by a single theory? How can \"any\" economic, social, or political theory be valid? The truth is, none of them really are. Mark Buchanan makes the fascinating argument that the science of physics is beginning to provide a new picture of the human or \"social atom,\" and help us understand the surprising, and often predictable, patterns that emerge when they get together. Look at patterns, not people, Buchanan argues, and rules emerge that can explain how movements form, how interest groups operate, and even why ethnic hatred persists. Using similar observations, social physicists can predict whether neighborhoods will integrate, whether stock markets will crash, and whether crime waves will continue or abate. Brimming with mind games and provocative experiments, \"The Social Atom\" is an incisive, accessible, and comprehensive argument for a whole new way to look at human social behavior. Mark Buchanan is a theoretical physicist and an associate editor at \"Complexus,\" a journal on biocomplexity. He has been an editor at \"Nature\" and \"New Scientist,\" and is the author of two prize-nominated books, \"Ubiquity: The Science of History\" and \"Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks.\" He lives in Cambridgeshire, England. The idiosyncrasies of human decision-making have confounded economists and social theorists for years. If each person makes choices for personal (and often irrational) reasons, how can people's choices be predicted by a single theory? The validity of any economic, social, or political theory comes into question. Mark Buchanan argues that the science of physics is beginning to provide a new picture of the human or \"social atom,\" and help us understand the surprising, and often predictable, patterns that emerge when they get together. Look at patterns, not people, Buchanan argues, and rules emerge that can explain how movements form, how interest groups operate, and even why ethnic hatred persists. Using similar observations, social physicists can predict whether neighborhoods will integrate, whether stock markets will crash, and whether crime waves will continue or abate.  \"The Social Atom\" is an incisive, accessible, and comprehensive argument for a new way to look at human social behavior. \"Mark Buchanan  is] a theoretical physicist . . . Buchanan argues that one of the basic assumptions of economics--namely, that humans make only reasoned, greedy, self-promoting decisions--is a simplification that calls the whole field into question . . . A former editor of the prestigious science journal \"Nature,\" Buchanan witnessed a growing number of physicists write papers about familiar mathematical patterns cropping up in human behavior. This inspired him to write \"The Social Atom.\" His goal is to consider people 'as if they were atoms or molecules following fairly simple rules' and investigate the idea that 'seemingly complicated social happenings may often have quite simple origins, and that we can discover such simplicity by examining how we too may be subject to laws not unlike those of physics' . . .  The book asks] readers to move away from thinking of humans as individuals when it comes to social behavior in a group. We are . . . simple atoms that think alike, copy one another and self-organize according to common mathematical patterns.\"--Russ Juskalian, \"USA Today\" \"Humans mimic other humans, whether they're clapping or buying mobile phones, writes Mark Buchanan in his beguiling behavioral study . . . Yet the same force may influence bigger decisions in life, like whether to have kids, he says. European birthrates slowed so dramatically between 1950 and 2000 that researchers concluded the trend was 'amplified and exaggerated by peer pressure' . . . A theoretical physicist, Buchanan suggests that sociologists should spend less time scrutinizing individual behavior and more time studying the group. 'Think of patterns, not people, ' he urges, arguing that people are the atoms, or building blocks, of the social world. We imitate each other, cooperate, learn and adapt in a giant feedback system. Writing in lean, fluid sentences, Buchanan clicks through examples ranging from the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management to the slaughter at Srebrenica. He shows patterns at work in phantom traffic jams, stock sell-offs and the trails human feet carve through public parks . . . As promised in the book's subtitle, Buchanan explains 'Why the Rich Get Richer, Cheaters Get Caught, and Your Neighbor Usually Looks Like You' . . .  Buchanan is] on to something big.\"--James Pressley, \"Bloomberg News\" \"Likely the \"Blink\" or \"Freakonomics \"of 2007, theoretical physicist Buchanan's new book explains how we replicate the behavior of people we admire, and stick close to people with shared fundamental bonds such as ethnic heritage.\"\"--Time Out Chicago\" \"Everything we think about why we do what we do is wrong because we can't help but think and act like individuals, understanding the world around us with anecdote and simple stories. But as Mark Buchanan brilliantly demonstrates with examples from the world all around us, there's a bigger force at work that explains the world far better. Surprisingly, that force looks a lot like the semi-random statistical model that explained the mysteries of quantum physics a century ago. This is a fascinating glimpse into a new way of understanding human behavior.\"--Chris Anderson, Editor-in-Chief, \"Wired Magazine,\" and author of \"The Long Tail: Why The Future of Business Is Selling Less of More\"\"\" \"Seldom has a book so infuriated me yet kept me tightly gripped to each page.

He was educated at Uppingham School and Merton College, Oxford, where he studied English.\nIn 2003, Haddon won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award and in 2004, the Commonwealth Writers' Prize Overall Best First Book for his novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, a book which is written from the perspective of a boy with Aspergers syndrome. Haddon's knowledge of Aspergers syndrome, a type of autism, comes from his work with autistic people as a young man. In an interview at Powells.com, Haddon claimed that this was the first book that he wrote intentionally for an adult audience; he was surprised when his publisher suggested marketing it to both adult and child audiences. His second adult-novel, A Spot of Bother, was published in September 2006.\nMark Haddon is also known for his series of Agent Z books, one of which, Agent Z and the Penguin from Mars, was made into a 1996 Children's BBC sitcom. He also wrote the screenplay for the BBC television adaptation of Raymond Briggs's story Fungus the Bogeyman, screened on BBC1 in 2004. He also wrote the 2007 BBC television drama Coming Down the Mountain.\nHaddon is a vegetarian, and enjoys vegetarian cookery. He describes himself as a 'hard-line atheist'. In an interview with The Observer, Haddon said \"I am atheist in a very religious mould\". His atheism might be inferred from The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time in which the main character declares that those who believe in God are stupid.","summary":"Mark Haddon's bitterly funny debut novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is a murder mystery of sorts--one told by an autistic version of Adrian Mole. Fifteen-year-old Christopher John Francis Boone is mathematically gifted and socially hopeless, raised in a working-class home by parents who can barely cope with their child's quirks. He takes everything that he sees (or is told) at face value, and is unable to sort out the strange behavior of his elders and peers.\r\nLate one night, Christopher comes across his neighbor's poodle, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork. Wellington's owner finds him cradling her dead dog in his arms, and has him arrested. After spending a night in jail, Christopher resolves--against the objection of his father and neighbors--to discover just who has murdered Wellington. He is encouraged by Siobhan, a social worker at his school, to write a book about his investigations, and the result--quirkily illustrated, with each chapter given its own prime number--is The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaddon's novel is a startling performance. This is the sort of book that could turn condescending, or exploitative, or overly sentimental, or grossly tasteless very easily, but Haddon navigates those dangers with a sureness of touch that is extremely rare among first-time novelists. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is original, clever, and genuinely moving: this one is a must-read. --Jack Illingworth, Amazon.ca--This text refers to the Hardcover edition.","price":"USD 14.95"},"book_id":"1291231","id":7104},{"status":"read","rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"updated":"2007-05-24 11:38:49","user_id":"1000001","tags":["商业","互联网"],"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":6,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Inside eBay","author":["Adam Cohen"],"pubdate":"03 June, 2003","tags":[{"count":6,"name":"商业","title":"商业"},{"count":5,"name":"创业","title":"创业"},{"count":4,"name":"eBay","title":"eBay"},{"count":3,"name":"互联网","title":"互联网"},{"count":1,"name":"蔡康永推荐","title":"蔡康永推荐"},{"count":1,"name":"澳洲","title":"澳洲"},{"count":1,"name":"The","title":"The"},{"count":1,"name":"Store:","title":"Store:"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s1401053.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"332","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s1401053.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s1401053.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s1401053.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/1395491/","id":"1395491","publisher":"Back Bay Books","isbn10":"0316164933","isbn13":"9780316164931","title":"The Perfect Store","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/1395491","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"In this brisk, engaging chronicle of one of the most stunning success stories in American business history, Adam Cohen takes us inside eBay the corporation--where all the important players, including eBay's founder Pierre Omidyar and CEO Meg Whitman, demystify their roles and tell the story straight--as well as inside the community of eBay's passionate users, who buy and sell everything from antique pickle jars and record albums to Ford trucks and $40,000 computer servers.

Collins and his team of researchers began their quest by sorting through a list of 1,435 companies, looking for those that made substantial improvements in their performance over time. They finally settled on 11--including Fannie Mae, Gillette, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo--and discovered common traits that challenged many of the conventional notions of corporate success. Making the transition from good to great doesn't require a high-profile CEO, the latest technology, innovative change management, or even a fine-tuned business strategy. At the heart of those rare and truly great companies was a corporate culture that rigorously found and promoted disciplined people to think and act in a disciplined manner. Peppered with dozens of stories and examples from the great and not so great, the book offers a well-reasoned road map to excellence that any organization would do well to consider. Like Built to Last, Good to Great is one of those books that managers and CEOs will be reading and rereading for years to come. --Harry C.

Drawing on a wide range of  sources, Jeffrey Young and William Simon provide new perspectives on the  legendary creation of Apple, detail Jobs's meteoric rise, and the  devastating plunge that left him not only out of Apple, but out of the  computer-making business entirely. This unflinching and completely  unauthorized portrait reveals both sides of Jobs's role in the remarkable  rise of the Pixar animation studio, also re-creates the acrimony between  Jobs and Disney's Michael Eisner, and examines Jobs's dramatic his rise  from the ashes with his recapture of Apple. The authors examine the  takeover and Jobs's reinvention of the company with the popular iMac and  his transformation of the industry with the revolutionary iPod. iCon is  must reading for anyone who wants to understand how the modern digital age has been formed, shaped, and refined by the most influential figure of the age-a master of three industries: movies, music, and computers.

According to John Battelle, a company that answers  that question -- in all its shades of meaning -- can unlock the most intractable  riddles of both business and culture.  And for the past few years, that's  exactly what Google has been doing. \n\n Jumping into the game long after Yahoo, Alta Vista, Excite, Lycos, and other  pioneers, Google offered a radical new approach to search, redefined the idea of  viral marketing, survived the dotcom crash, and pulled off the largest and most  talked about initial public offering in the history of Silicon Valley. \n\n But The Search offers much more than the inside story of Google's  triumph. It's also a big-picture book about the past, present, and future of  search technology, and the enormous impact it is starting to have on marketing,  media, pop culture, dating, job hunting, international law, civil liberties, and  just about every other sphere of human interest.   \n\n More than any of its rivals, Google has become the gateway to instant knowledge.  Hundreds of millions of people use it to satisfy their wants, needs, fears, and  obsessions, creating an enormous artifact that Battelle calls \"the Database of  Intentions.\"  Somewhere in Google's archives, for instance, you can find the  agonized research of a gay man with AIDS, the silent plotting of a would-be  bombmaker, and the anxiety of a woman checking out her blind date.  Combined  with the databases of thousands of other search-driven businesses, large and  small, it all adds up to a goldmine of information that powerful organizations  (including the government) will want to get their hands on. \n\n No one is better qualified to explain this entire phenomenon than Battelle, who  cofounded Wired and founded The Industry Standard.  Perhaps more  than any other journalist, he has devoted his career to finding the holy grail  of technology -- something as transformational as the Macintosh was in the mid- 1980s. And he has finally found it in search. \n\n Battelle draws on more than 350 interviews with major players from Silicon  Valley to Seattle to Wall Street, including Google cofounders Larry Page and  Sergey Brin and CEO Eric Schmidt, as well as competitors like Louis Monier, who  invented AltaVista, and Neil Moncrief, a soft-spoken Georgian whose business  Google built, destroyed, and built again.   \n\n Battelle lucidly reveals how search technology actually works, explores the  amazing power of targeted advertising, and reports on the frenzy of the Google  IPO, when the company tried to rewrite the rules of Wall Street and declared  \"don't be evil\" as its corporate motto.  \n\n For anyone who wants to understand how Google really succeeded -- and the  implications of a world in which every click can be preserved forever -- THE  SEARCH is an eye-opening and indispensable read.","price":"USD 25.95"},"book_id":"1427609","id":609307},{"status":"read","rating":{"max":5,"value":"3","min":0},"updated":"2006-12-28 22:46:15","user_id":"1000001","tags":["fiction"],"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":125,"average":"8.2","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Elizabeth Kostova"],"pubdate":"2005-6-14","tags":[{"count":33,"name":"vampire","title":"vampire"},{"count":25,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":23,"name":"fiction","title":"fiction"},{"count":17,"name":"悬疑","title":"悬疑"},{"count":13,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":11,"name":"英文","title":"英文"},{"count":9,"name":"奇幻","title":"奇幻"},{"count":6,"name":"Dracula","title":"Dracula"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s4748269.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"642","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s4748269.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s4748269.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s4748269.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/1418853/","id":"1418853","publisher":"Little, Brown and Company","isbn10":"0316011770","isbn13":"9780316011778","title":"The Historian","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/1418853","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"To you, perceptive reader, I bequeath my history....Late one night, exploring her father's library, a young woman finds an ancient book and a cache of yellowing letters. The letters are all addressed to \"My dear and unfortunate successor,\" and they plunge her into a world she never dreamed of-a labyrinth where the secrets of her father's past and her mother's mysterious fate connect to an inconceivable evil hidden in the depths of history.The letters provide links to one of the darkest powers that humanity has ever known-and to a centuries-long quest to find the source of that darkness and wipe it out. It is a quest for the truth about Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler whose barbarous reign formed the basis of the legend of Dracula. Generations of historians have risked their reputations, their sanity, and even their lives to learn the truth about Vlad the Impaler and Dracula. Now one young woman must decide whether to take up this quest herself-to follow her father in a hunt that nearly brought him to ruin years ago, when he was a vibrant young scholar and her mother was still alive. What does the legend of Vlad the Impaler have to do with the modern world? Is it possible that the Dracula of myth truly existed-and that he has lived on, century after century, pursuing his own unknowable ends? The answers to these questions cross time and borders, as first the father and then the daughter search for clues, from dusty Ivy League libraries to Istanbul, Budapest, and the depths of Eastern Europe. In city after city, in monasteries and archives, in letters and in secret conversations, the horrible truth emerges about Vlad the Impaler's dark reign-and about a time-defying pact that may have kept his awful work alive down through the ages.Parsing obscure signs and hidden texts, reading codes worked into the fabric of medieval monastic traditions-and evading the unknown adversaries who will go to any lengths to conceal and protect Vlad's ancient powers-one woman comes ever closer to the secret of her own past and a confrontation with the very definition of evil. Elizabeth Kostova's debut novel is an adventure of monumental proportions, a relentless tale that blends fact and fantasy, history and the present, with an assurance that is almost unbearably suspenseful-and utterly unforgettable.","price":"USD 25.95"},"book_id":"1418853","id":8555866},{"status":"read","rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"updated":"2006-12-08 12:07:13","user_id":"1000001","book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":79,"average":"8.6","min":0},"subtitle":"How Everything is Connected to Everything Else and What It Means for Business, Science, and Everyday Life","author":["Albert-Laszlo Barabasi"],"pubdate":"2003-4-29","tags":[{"count":50,"name":"socialnetwork","title":"socialnetwork"},{"count":41,"name":"社会网络","title":"社会网络"},{"count":34,"name":"互联网","title":"互联网"},{"count":31,"name":"Linked","title":"Linked"},{"count":30,"name":"社会性网络","title":"社会性网络"},{"count":21,"name":"Social","title":"Social"},{"count":19,"name":"web","title":"web"},{"count":17,"name":"science","title":"science"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s27426300.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"294","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s27426300.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s27426300.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s27426300.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/1355595/","id":"1355595","publisher":"Plume","isbn10":"0452284392","isbn13":"9780452284395","title":"Linked","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/1355595","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"A cocktail party.

While Guns, Germs, and Steel explained the geographic and environmental reasons why some human populations have flourished, Collapse uses the same factors to examine why ancient societies, including the Anasazi of the American Southwest and the Viking colonies of Greenland, as well as modern ones such as Rwanda, have fallen apart. Not every collapse has an environmental origin, but an eco-meltdown is often the main catalyst, he argues, particularly when combined with society's response to (or disregard for) the coming disaster. Still, right from the outset of Collapse, the author makes clear that this is not a mere environmentalist's diatribe. He begins by setting the book's main question in the small communities of present-day Montana as they face a decline in living standards and a depletion of natural resources. Once-vital mines now leak toxins into the soil, while prion diseases infect some deer and elk and older hydroelectric dams have become decrepit. On all these issues, and particularly with the hot-button topic of logging and wildfires, Diamond writes with equanimity. \n\nBecause he's addressing such significant issues within a vast span of time, Diamond can occasionally speak too briefly and assume too much, and at times his shorthand remarks may cause careful readers to raise an eyebrow. But in general, Diamond provides fine and well-reasoned historical examples, making the case that many times, economic and environmental concerns are one and the same. With Collapse, Diamond hopes to jog our collective memory to keep us from falling for false analogies or forgetting prior experiences, and thereby save us from potential devastations to come. While it might seem a stretch to use medieval Greenland and the Maya to convince a skeptic about the seriousness of global warming, it's exactly this type of cross-referencing that makes Collapse so compelling. \n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　--Jennifer Buckendorff \n\n From   Publishers Weekly   \nIn his Pulitzer Prize–winning bestseller Guns, Germs, and Steel, geographer Diamond laid out a grand view of the organic roots of human civilizations in flora, fauna, climate and geology. That vision takes on apocalyptic overtones in this fascinating comparative study of societies that have, sometimes fatally, undermined their own ecological foundations. Diamond examines storied examples of human economic and social collapse, and even extinction, including Easter Island, classical Mayan civilization and the Greenland Norse. He explores patterns of population growth, overfarming, overgrazing and overhunting, often abetted by drought, cold, rigid social mores and warfare, that lead inexorably to vicious circles of deforestation, erosion and starvation prompted by the disappearance of plant and animal food sources. Extending his treatment to contemporary environmental trouble spots, from Montana to China to Australia, he finds today's global, technologically advanced civilization very far from solving the problems that plagued primitive, isolated communities in the remote past. At times Diamond comes close to a counsel of despair when contemplating the environmental havoc engulfing our rapidly industrializing planet, but he holds out hope at examples of sustainability from highland New Guinea's age-old but highly diverse and efficient agriculture to Japan's rigorous program of forest protection and, less convincingly, in recent green consumerism initiatives. Diamond is a brilliant expositor of everything from anthropology to zoology, providing a lucid background of scientific lore to support a stimulating, incisive historical account of these many declines and falls. Readers will find his book an enthralling, and disturbing, reminder of the indissoluble links that bind humans to nature. Photos. \n\n From   Booklist   \nDefining collapse as \"extreme decline,\" the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997), which posed questions about Western civilization's domination of much of the world, now examines the reverse side of that coin. Diamond ponders reasons why certain civilizations have collapsed. With an eye on the implications for the present and future, he bases his analysis on his newly phrased version of an old maxim about what history teaches: \"The past offers us a rich database from which we can learn.\" Drawing examples from this database, from Polynesian culture on Easter Island to the Viking outposts in Greenland to the Mayan civilization in Central America, the author finds \"the fundamental pattern of catastrophe\" that is apparent in these populations that once flourished and then collapsed. The template he holds up is a construct based on five factors, including environmental damage, climate change, and hostile neighbors. In addition, Diamond casts his critical but acute and inclusive gaze on the issue of why civilizations fail to see collapse coming. A thought-provoking book containing not a single page of dense prose. Expect demand from civic- and history-minded readers. \n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Brad Hooper\n\n From   School Library Journal   \nAdult/High School–This powerful call to action should be read by all high school students. Diamond eloquently and persuasively describes the environmental and social problems that led to the collapse of previous civilizations and threaten us today. The book's organization makes researching particular regions or types of damage accessible. Unfamiliar words are defined, and mention of a place or issue that has been described in greater detail elsewhere includes relevant page numbers. Students may become impatient with the folksy Montana fishing stories in part one, but once the fascinating account of the vanished civilizations begins, readers are taken on an extraordinary journey. Using the Mayan empire, Easter Island, the Anasazi, and other examples, the author shows how a combination of environmental factors such as habitat destruction, the loss of biodiversity, and degradation of the soil caused complex, flourishing societies to suddenly disintegrate. Modern societies are divided into those that have begun to collapse, such as Rwanda and Haiti; those whose conservation policies have helped to avert disaster, such as Iceland and Japan; and those currently dealing with massive problems, such as Australia and China. Diamond is a cautious optimist. Some of his most compelling stories show how two groups of people sharing the same land, such as the Norse and Inuit in Greenland, can end up in completely different situations depending on how they address their problems. The solutions discussed are of vital importance: how societies respond to environmental degradation will determine how teens will live their adult lives. As Diamond points out, in a collapsing civilization, being rich just means being the last to starve.

The annual Nobel Prize winner in that field never receives as much publicity as his or her compatriots in peace, literature, or physics. But if such slights are based on the notion that economics is dull, or that economists are concerned only with finance itself, Steven D. Levitt will change some minds. In Freakonomics (written with Stephen J. Dubner), Levitt argues that many apparent mysteries of everyday life don't need to be so mysterious: they could be illuminated and made even more fascinating by asking the right questions and drawing connections. For example, Levitt traces the drop in violent crime rates to a drop in violent criminals and, digging further, to the Roe v. Wade decision that preempted the existence of some people who would be born to poverty and hardship. Elsewhere, by analyzing data gathered from inner-city Chicago drug-dealing gangs, Levitt outlines a corporate structure much like McDonald's, where the top bosses make great money while scores of underlings make something below minimum wage. And in a section that may alarm or relieve worried parents, Levitt argues that parenting methods don't really matter much and that a backyard swimming pool is much more dangerous than a gun. These enlightening chapters are separated by effusive passages from Dubner's 2003 profile of Levitt in The New York Times Magazine, which led to the book being written. In a book filled with bold logic, such back-patting veers Freakonomics, however briefly, away from what Levitt actually has to say.

Its goals grew, too, from the more modest, albeit fundamental one of offering high-quality coffee beans roasted to perfection to, more recently, opening a new store somewhere every day. An exemplary success story, Starbucks is identified with innovative marketing strategies, employee-ownership programs, and a product that's become a subculture. \n\nWhether you're an entrepreneur, a manager, a marketer, or a curious Starbucks loyalist, Pour Your Heart into It will let you in on the revolutionary Starbucks venture. CEO Howard Schultz recounts the company's rise in 24 chapters, each of which illustrates such core values as \"Winning at the expense of employees is not victory at all.\" --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title. \n\nFrom Library Journal\n\nThe author is the entrepreneur behind Starbucks, the coffee-shop chain with a \"passion\" for quality coffee. Through the voice of Eric Conger, Schultz speaks poetically about the \"mystery and romance\" of the \"coffee experience.\" Well, to some people coffee is like that. The program is not so much for those who want to learn about business techniques as for those who love Starbucks. Schultz's story is an interesting one, largely a personal narrative about making it big. At one point the narration says, \"It's not about me,\" but to a great extent the tapes really are.

Far beyond what we would have dared to imagine, \"Built to Last\" has lived up to its own name. \nIronically, we can claim no credit for the title. Creativity often sprouts from frustration, and our editors in 1994 were frustrated in the extreme. We had inserted a clause into our publishing contract that gave us final right of approval, and as the publication date neared, we just kept vetoing titles. In all, something on the order of 127 different options fell by the wayside, from \"You are the Competition\" to \"Research Results on Visionary Companies.\" \n\nThe situation finally escalated to the executive editor for HarperCollins, who went home for the weekend and returned on Monday morning with an idea. \"Here,\" he said, throwing a three by five note card on our editor's desk, \"see if they'll go for this.\" On it he'd written the simple phrase \"Built to Last.\" \n\nAnd we had our title. \n\nIn retrospect, \"Built to Last\" is a great title, but it is also the wrong title. Not from a marketing standpoint (don't get us wrong, we'd still keep it), but from the standpoint of what this book is really all about. \"Built to Last,\" it turns out, is not fundamentally about building to last. It is about building something that is worthy of lasting — about building a company of such intrinsic excellence that the world would lose something important if that organization ceased to exist. Implicit on every page is a simple question: Why on Earthwould you settle for creating something mediocre that does little more than make money, when you can create something outstanding that makes a lasting contribution as well? And in the end, as the evidence from our research showed, those who make a lasting contribution make more money over the long run anyway. \n\nIf we were rewriting \"Built to Last\" today, we would not overturn any of the basic concepts; they are timeless principles. We certainly know more about great companies than we did in 1994, and there is certainly much that we could add, but our faith in the fundamental findings has not faded. Indeed, we are more convinced than ever that building an enduring great company — one that is truly worthy of lasting — is a noble cause. \n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Jim Collins and Jerry Porras\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　March 31, 2002\n\nSynopsis:\n\nDrawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies and studied each in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day — as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: \"What makes the truly exceptional companies different from the comparison companies and what were the common practices these enduringly great companies followed throughout their history?\" \n\nFilled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the 21st century and beyond.\n\nFrom Amazon.com\n\nBuilt to Last became an instant business classic. This audio abridgement is read by the authors, who alternate chapters. Collins is a bit breathlessly enthusiastic, but clear and interesting; Porras, unfortunately, is poorly inflected and wooden. They set out to determine what's special about \"visionary\" companies--the Disneys, Wal-Marts, and Mercks, companies at the very top of their game that have demonstrated longevity and great brand image. The authors compare 18 \"visionary\" picks to a control group of \"successful-but-second-rank\" companies. Thus Disney is compared to Columbia Pictures, Ford to GM, and so on.\n\nA central myth, according to the authors, is that visionary companies start with a great product and are pushed into the future by charismatic leaders. Usually false, Collins and Porras find. Much more important, and a much more telling line of demarcation between a wild success like 3M and an also-ran like Norton, is flexibility. 3M had no master plan, little structure, and no prima donnas. Instead it had an atmosphere in which bright people were not afraid to \"try a lot of stuff and keep what works.\"\n\nIf you listen to this audiocassette on your daily commute, you may discover whether you are headed to a \"visionary\" place of work--and, if so, whether you are the kind of employee who fits your employer's vision. (Running time: two hours, two cassettes) --Richard Farr \n\nFrom Library Journal\n\nWhat makes a visionary company? This book, written by a team from Stanford's Graduate School of Business, compares what the authors have identified as \"visionary\" companies with selected companies in the same industry. The authors juxtapose Disney and Columbia Pictures, Ford and General Motors, Motorola and Zenith, and Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments, to name a few. The visionary companies, the authors found out, had a number of common characteristics; for instance, almost all had some type of core ideology that guided the company in times of upheaval and served as a constant bench mark. Not all the visionary companies were founded by visionary leaders, however. On the whole, this is an intriguing book that occasionally provides rare and interesting glimpses into the inner workings and philosophical foundations of successful businesses.

As chairman and chief executive officer of Citigroup, Sanford \"Sandy\" Weill has become an American legend, a banking visionary whose innovativeness, opportunism, and even fear drove him from the lowliest jobs on Wall Street to its most commanding heights. In this unprecedented biography, acclaimed  Wall Street Journal  reporter Monica Langley provides a compelling account of Weill's rise to power. What emerges is a portrait of a man who is as vital and as volatile as the market itself.  Tearing Down the Walls  tells the riveting inside story of how a Jewish boy from Brooklyn's back alleys overcame incredible odds and deep-seated prejudices to transform the financial-services industry as we know it today.   Using nearly five hundred firsthand interviews with key players in Weill's life and career -- including Weill himself -- Langley brilliantly chronicles not only his success and scandals but also the shadows of his hidden self: his father's abandonment and his loving marriage; his tyrannical rages as well as his tearful regrets; his fierce sense of loyalty and his ruthless elimination of potential rivals. By highlighting in new and startling detail one man's life in a narrative as richly textured and compelling as a novel,  Tearing Down the Walls  provides the historical context of the dramatic changes not only in business but also in American society in the last half century.","price":"USD 28.99"},"book_id":"1440556","id":705065},{"status":"read","rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"updated":"2005-12-02 11:05:52","user_id":"1000001","tags":["金融"],"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":73,"average":"7.8","min":0},"subtitle":"Including a Life-Cycle Guide to Personal Investing","author":["Burton G.

In a world in which lives are shaped by irrevocable choices and by fortuitous events, a world in which everything occurs but once, existence seems to lose its substance, its weight. Hence, we feel \"the unbearable lightness of being\" not only as the consequence of our pristine actions but also in the public sphere, and the two inevitably intertwine. \n\n From  AudioFile  \nJonathan Oliver employs a husky-voiced tone that proves the right match for this darkish story, one that requires of listeners a dollop of patience. Set first in Czechoslovakia, then in Switzerland, Kundera's story tells the sometimes laborious story of a womanizing Czech surgeon forced to flee the Russian invasion and take on menial roles, giving his passion for the flesh a slighly different perspective, as he is no longer a doctor but just a window-washer. His relationship with this current female-of-choice, the interesting and puzzling Tereza, is at the center of the novel.

His 1988 novel Foucault's Pendulum has been described as a \"thinking person's Da Vinci Code\". Eco is President of the Scuola Superiore di Studi Umanistici, University of Bologna. He has also written academic texts, children’s books and many essays. Eco was born in the city of Alessandria in the region of Piedmont. His father, Giulio, was an accountant before the government called upon him to serve in three wars. During World War II, Umberto and his mother, Giovanna, moved to a small village in the Piedmontese mountainside. Eco received a Salesian education, and he has made references to the order and its founder in his works and interviews. His family name is supposedly an acronym of ex caelis oblatus (Latin: a gift from the heavens), which was given to his grandfather (a foundling) by a city official. His father was the son of a family with thirteen children, and urged Umberto to become a lawyer, but he entered the University of Turin in order to take up medieval philosophy and literature, writing his thesis on Thomas Aquinas and earning his BA in philosophy in 1954. During this time, Eco left the Roman Catholic Church after a crisis of faith. After this, Eco worked as a cultural editor for the state broadcasting station Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI) and also lectured at the University of Turin (1956–64). A group of avant-garde artists—painters, musicians, writers—whom he had befriended at RAI (Gruppo 63) became an important and influential component in Eco's future writing career. This was especially true after the publication of his first book in 1956, Il problema estetico di San Tommaso, which was an extension of his doctoral thesis. This also marked the beginning of his lecturing career at his alma mater. In September 1962, he married Renate Ramge, a German art teacher with whom he has a son and a daughter. He divides his time between an apartment in Milan and a vacation house near Rimini.","summary":"The year is 1327. Franciscans in a wealthy Italian abbey are suspected of heresy, and Brother William of Baskerville arrives to investigate.

These dramatic words appeared in the final pages of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. In the midst of this battle of good and evil, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince takes up the story of Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, with Voldemort's power and followers increasing day by day \n\n Amazon.co.uk \nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the sixth book in J.K. Rowling’s bestselling series, picks up shortly after we left Harry at the end of The Order of the Phoenix. Lord Voldemort is acting out in the open, continuing his reign of terror which was temporarily stopped almost 15 years beforehand. Harry is again at the Dursleys, where the events of the previous month continue to weigh on his mind, although not as much as the impending visit from his Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. Given their last meeting, Harry is understandably confused as to why the old wizard would want to visit him at home. \n\nRowling opens with a chapter she had wanted to use for the first book, of The Philosopher’s Stone--Lord Voldemort has been creating chaos in the Wizard and Muggle communities alike, the war is in full swing and the Wizarding community now lives in fear. The press have been questioning the events at the Ministry which led to the admission of Voldemort’s return, and of course Harry’s name is mentioned a number of times. Harry’s got his problems, but his anxiety is nothing compared to Hermione’s when the OWL results are delivered. There’s a new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher, an assortment of new characters and creatures, and startling revelations about past characters and events. \n\nGone is the rage-filled Harry of The Order of the Phoenix--he’s not being kept in the dark any more, his unjustified Quidditch ban has been lifted and he has matured considerably in his short time out of school. Half-Blood Prince follows Harry into the world of late-teens, and his realisation that nobody is infallible has made his growth that much easier. Accepting his destiny, Harry continues to behave as teenagers do, enjoying his time with his friends, developing his relationships outside of his usual circle, and learning more about how he must, eventually, do what he is destined to do. \n\nJ.K. Rowling delivers another fantastic tale which will have the readers gasping for more, capturing the characters perfectly and continuing a tale which readers will enjoy over and over again. \n--Ziggy Morbi \n\n About Author \nJ.K. Rowling was a struggling single mother when she wrote the beginning of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, on scraps of paper at a local cafe. But her efforts soon paid off, as she received an unprecedented award from the Scottish Arts Council enabling her to finish the book. Since then, the debut novel has become an international phenomenon, garnering rave reviews and major awards, including the British Book Awards Chidren's Book of the Year and the Smarties Prize. Ms. Rowling lives in Edinburgh with her daughter.","ebook_price":"29.72","price":"GBP 16.99"},"book_id":"1288972","id":399349},{"status":"read","updated":"2005-08-24 18:08:01","user_id":"1000001","book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":748,"average":"8.9","min":0},"subtitle":"5/7","author":["J.K.

He graduated from Cornell University and reported for the Wall Street Journal for more than a decade, including two years writing its Heard on the Street column, 1989 to 1991. Born in 1954, he is the son of Helen and Louis Lowenstein of Larchmont, N.Y. Lowenstein is married to Judith Slovin.\nHe is also a director of Sequoia Fund. His father, the late Louis Lowenstein, was an attorney and Columbia University law professor who wrote books and articles critical of the American financial industry.\nRoger Lowenstein's latest book, America's Bank: The Epic Struggle to Create the Federal Reserve (The Penguin Press) was released on October 20, 2015.\nHe has three children and lives in Westfield, New Jersey.","summary":"On September 23, 1998, the boardroom of the New York Fed was a tense place. Around the table sat the heads of every major Wall Street bank, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, and representatives from numerous European banks, each of whom had been summoned to discuss a highly unusual prospect: rescuing what had, until then, been the envy of them all, the extraordinarily successful bond-trading firm of Long-Term Capital Management. Roger Lowenstein's When Genius Failed is the gripping story of the Fed's unprecedented move, the incredible heights reached by LTCM, and the firm's eventual dramatic demise.\nLowenstein, a financial journalist and author of Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist, examines the personalities, academic experts, and professional relationships at LTCM and uncovers the layers of numbers behind its roller-coaster ride with the precision of a skilled surgeon. The fund's enigmatic founder, John Meriwether, spent almost 20 years at Salomon Brothers, where he formed its renowned Arbitrage Group by hiring academia's top financial economists. Though Meriwether left Salomon under a cloud of the SEC's wrath, he leapt into his next venture with ease and enticed most of his former Salomon hires--and eventually even David Mullins, the former vice chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve--to join him in starting a hedge fund that would beat all hedge funds.\nLTCM began trading in 1994, after completing a road show that, despite the Ph.D.-touting partners' lack of social skills and their disdainful condescension of potential investors who couldn't rise to their intellectual level, netted a whopping $1.25 billion. The fund would seek to earn a tiny spread on thousands of trades, \"as if it were vacuuming nickels that others couldn't see,\" in the words of one of its Nobel laureate partners, Myron Scholes. And nickels it found. In its first two years, LTCM earned $1.6 billion, profits that exceeded 40 percent even after the partners' hefty cuts. By the spring of 1996, it was holding $140 billion in assets. But the end was soon in sight, and Lowenstein's detailed account of each successively worse month of 1998, culminating in a disastrous August and the partners' subsequent panicked moves, is riveting.\nThe arbitrageur's world is a complicated one, and it might have served Lowenstein well to slow down and explain in greater detail the complex terms of the more exotic species of investment flora that cram the book's pages. However, much of the intrigue of the Long-Term story lies in its dizzying pace (not to mention the dizzying amounts of money won and lost in the fund's short lifespan). Lowenstein's smooth, conversational but equally urgent tone carries it along well. The book is a compelling read for those who've always wondered what lay behind the Fed's controversial involvement with the LTCM hedge-fund debacle. --S.

As the defiant but sensitive young genius is creating his theory of relativity, a new conception of time, he imagines many possible worlds. In one, time is circular, so that people are fated to repeat triumphs and failures over and over.

The victim is a high-ranking agent of this ancient society who, in the moments before his death, manages to leave gruesome clues at the scene that only his granddaughter, noted cryptographer Sophie Neveu, and Robert Langdon, a famed symbologist, can untangle. The duo become both suspects and detectives searching for not only Neveu's grandfather's murderer but also the stunning secret of the ages he was charged to protect. Mere steps ahead of the authorities and the deadly competition, the mystery leads Neveu and Langdon on a breathless flight through France, England, and history itself. Brown (Angels and Demons) has created a page-turning thriller that also provides an amazing interpretation of Western history. Brown's hero and heroine embark on a lofty and intriguing exploration of some of Western culture's greatest mysteries--from the nature of the Mona Lisa's smile to the secret of the Holy Grail. Though some will quibble with the veracity of Brown's conjectures, therein lies the fun. The Da Vinci Code is an enthralling read that provides rich food for thought. \n                 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　--Jeremy Pugh\n\n From   Publishers Weekly   \nBrown's latest thriller (after Angels and Demons)is an exhaustively researched page-turner about secret religious societies, ancient coverups and savage vengeance. The action kicks off in modern-day Paris with the murder of the Louvre's chief curator, whose body is found laid out in symbolic repose at the foot of the Mona Lisa. Seizing control of the case are Sophie Neveu, a lovely French police cryptologist, and Harvard symbol expert Robert Langdon, reprising his role from Brown's last book. The two find several puzzling codes at the murder scene, all of which form a treasure map to the fabled Holy Grail. As their search moves from France to England, Neveu and Langdon are confounded by two mysterious groups-the legendary Priory of Sion, a nearly 1,000-year-old secret society whose members have included Botticelli and Isaac Newton, and the conservative Catholic organization Opus Dei. Both have their own reasons for wanting to ensure that the Grail isn't found. Brown sometimes ladles out too much religious history at the expense of pacing, and Langdon is a hero in desperate need of more chutzpah. Still, Brown has assembled a whopper of a plot that will please both conspiracy buffs and thriller addicts.\n\n From   Library Journal   \nWhen Brown regular Robert Langdon is called in to investigate the murder of a curator at the Louvre, he discovers that the body is surrounded by strange ciphers evidently linked to the paintings of Da Vinci-and a powerful relic protected by the Priory, a secret society to which the artist belonged. \n\n From   Booklist   \nIn a two-day span, American symbologist Robert Langdon finds himself accused of murdering the curator of the Louvre, on the run through the streets of Paris and London, and teamed up with French cryptologist Sophie Neveu to uncover nothing less than the secret location of the Holy Grail. It appears that a conservative Catholic bishop might be on the verge of destroying the Grail, which includes an alternate history of Christ that could bring down the church. Whoever is ordering the deaths of the Grail's guardians--modern-day members of an ancient society descended from the famed Knights Templar--must be stopped before the treasure is lost forever. To do so, Langdon and Neveu have to solve a series of ciphers and riddles while evading a tireless French police commander and a ruthless albino monk. Despite being hampered by clunky flashback sequences and place descriptions that read like tourist brochures, the story is full of brain-teasing puzzles and fascinating insights into religious history and art. Ultimately, Brown's intricate plot delivers more satisfying twists than a licorice factory. \n 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Frank Sennett\n\n Book Dimension   \nlength: (cm)17.8    　　　            　　　　　            　　　　　 width:(cm)11.1","price":""},"book_id":"1343950","id":81664},{"status":"read","rating":{"max":5,"value":"4","min":0},"updated":"2005-07-17 10:40:08","user_id":"1000001","tags":["时间旅行","小说"],"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1106,"average":"8.4","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Audrey Niffenegger"],"pubdate":"2004-5-27","tags":[{"count":268,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":236,"name":"时间旅行","title":"时间旅行"},{"count":231,"name":"爱情","title":"爱情"},{"count":114,"name":"英文小說","title":"英文小說"},{"count":114,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":94,"name":"外国文学","title":"外国文学"},{"count":88,"name":"科幻","title":"科幻"},{"count":85,"name":"英文","title":"英文"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s1394517.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"546","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s1394517.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s1394517.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s1394517.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/1388182/","id":"1388182","publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","isbn10":"015602943X","isbn13":"9780156029438","title":"The Time Traveler's Wife","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/1388182","alt_title":"时间旅行者的妻子","author_intro":"","summary":"A most untraditional love story, this is the celebrated tale of Henry DeTamble, a dashing, adventuresome librarian who involuntarily travels through time, and Clare Abshite, an artist whose life take a natural sequential course.

He is currently a staff writer for The New Yorker.","summary":"\"The best way to understand the dramatic transformation of unknown books into bestsellers, or the rise of teenage smoking, or the phenomena of word of mouth or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life,\" writes Malcolm Gladwell, \"is to think of them as epidemics. Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses do.\" Although anyone familiar with the theory of memetics will recognize this concept, Gladwell's The Tipping Point has quite a few interesting twists on the subject.\nFor example, Paul Revere was able to galvanize the forces of resistance so effectively in part because he was what Gladwell calls a \"Connector\": he knew just about everybody, particularly the revolutionary leaders in each of the towns that he rode through. But Revere \"wasn't just the man with the biggest Rolodex in colonial Boston,\" he was also a \"Maven\" who gathered extensive information about the British. He knew what was going on and he knew exactly whom to tell. The phenomenon continues to this day--think of how often you've received information in an e-mail message that had been forwarded at least half a dozen times before reaching you.\nGladwell develops these and other concepts (such as the \"stickiness\" of ideas or the effect of population size on information dispersal) through simple, clear explanations and entertainingly illustrative anecdotes, such as comparing the pedagogical methods of Sesame Street and Blue's Clues, or explaining why it would be even easier to play Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon with the actor Rod Steiger. Although some readers may find the transitional passages between chapters hold their hands a little too tightly, and Gladwell's closing invocation of the possibilities of social engineering sketchy, even chilling, The Tipping Point is one of the most effective books on science for a general audience in ages. It seems inevitable that \"tipping point,\" like \"future shock\" or \"chaos theory,\" will soon become one of those ideas that everybody knows--or at least knows by name. --Ron Hogan, Amazon.com","price":"15.99美元"},"book_id":"1291075","id":2883},{"status":"read","rating":{"max":5,"value":"5","min":0},"updated":"2005-06-12 02:21:36","user_id":"1000001","tags":["非洲","自传","成长","最爱"],"book":{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":148,"average":"9.4","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Beryl Markham"],"pubdate":"1983-5-1","tags":[{"count":61,"name":"非洲","title":"非洲"},{"count":46,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":45,"name":"自传","title":"自传"},{"count":43,"name":"传记","title":"传记"},{"count":31,"name":"飞行","title":"飞行"},{"count":31,"name":"回忆录","title":"回忆录"},{"count":23,"name":"文学","title":"文学"},{"count":22,"name":"外国文学","title":"外国文学"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s24325345.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"294","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/s/public/s24325345.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s24325345.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com/view/subject/m/public/s24325345.jpg"},"alt":"https://book.douban.com/subject/1291076/","id":"1291076","publisher":"North Point Press","isbn10":"0865471185","isbn13":"9780865471184","title":"West with the Night","url":"https://api.douban.com/v2/book/1291076","alt_title":"夜航西飛","author_intro":"","summary":"A direct, stylish, and engrossing story of a marvelous life well lived.

\n    面对这前无古人、惟我独尊的豪言壮语，人们不禁要问：这《汉字密码》（上、下册）在汉字研究方面究竟提出了什么样的“新立论”、“新突破”呢？ \n    笔者耐着性子，从头到尾地读完了这本“奇书”，发现它并未曾完全“推翻”文字学的“旧说”；相反地，书中不仅沿袭了许多学者的研究成果，而且把别人摹写的一些古文的字例复印过来据为己有。——但是，如果说作者没有自己的新“创造”，那也有些冤枉。他最突出的“创新”，就是无中生有地用“生殖文化”和“屁文化”（请注意：这是作者的原话，而不是强加于他的话！）去肆无忌惮地曲解不少汉字的字源。 \n    本人不准备过多地引录这本“奇书”独有的奇谈怪论，以维护报纸的纯洁性，只在不得不引录的时候才举少数的例子，因为这《汉字密码》（上、下册）中确实充斥着大量的不堪入目的描述“性”的文字。 \n    如所周知，汉字中极少数与“性”有关的字源，自古以来早有一些文字学家揭示或论述过，例如“也”字是“女阴也”；“且”（“祖”的本字）源自男性的性器形状；“匕”、“”分别是雌、雄动物的符号（像“”、“牡”等字的偏旁）等。但是仅此而已，汉字在事实上并不存在所谓的“生殖文化”和“屁文化”；汉字研究也不存在所谓的“受士大夫观念的影响，耻于谈性”的现象。  \n    而《汉字密码》的作者却用了占全书分量很大的一部分篇幅，以主观想像去代替严肃的科学的学术研究，断言不少的汉字都是来源于人类甚至兽类的“性”。 \n    作者所采用的“论述”方式是：先毫无根据地虚构出一些“符号”，然后据此“推论”出一批汉字的“字源”来。例如“倒（△）”是“女性符号”，由这个符号“孳乳”出来的汉字有“帝”、“不”、“丕”、“否”、“黄”、“同”、“才”、“在”等；“△”是“男性符号”，由它“孳乳”出“享”、“亨”、“余”、“叙”、“食”、“令”、“命”等字；“”和“△”的结合又产生出“合”、“会”、“高”、“京”、“膏”等字。其实，这些汉字的字源，有许多早有公认的定论，却被作者统统“推翻”了。 \n    除用这个方法之外，作者又牵强附会，把更多的本来与“生殖文化”、“屁文化”无关的汉字也挂上了钩，这里只举数例： \n    把甲骨文“男”字的下半部、“吉”字的上半部、“父”字的竖笔等不同的形体都说成是“男性生殖器”，甚至把“酉”字倒置过来也算是一例； \n    把甲骨文“卑”字的上半部、“公”字的下半部、“申”和“文”的整体都说成是“女性生殖器”； \n    把甲骨文、金文“系”、“玄”、“率”、“胤”、“绍”、“素”、“繁”、“组”、“幼”、“绝”等字的构成部分“∞”都说成是“脐带”； \n    把“方”字说成“用生殖器朝向对方”；把“臾”字说成“表示男子的自慰，即双手将生殖器勃起后的手淫”；把“予”字说成“男女性交以射精为终结，……有给予之义”；“宴”字的本义是“用女人款待来客。……源自上古时期，女俘虏属大家共有，并用之招待客人的习俗”；“毋”则“表示禁止与母亲发生性关系”；而“用”字居然是“大便后用树枝、草根擦屁股”！……——够了，够了！这部“奇书”中龌龊不堪的“奇思妙想”还不止这些，不能再引述了，真是匪夷所思，我们不得不“佩服”作者：亏他想得出来！ \n    从一些字倒可以看出这《汉字密码》（上、下册）的作者在“论述”汉字时是随意性的和自相矛盾的。例如，作者把“同”、“舍”等少数汉字下面的“口”解释为“女性生殖器”，却对包含“口”这个偏旁的大量汉字视而不见，避而不谈。这谈得上起码的实事求是的科学态度吗？ \n    据《汉字密码》的作者说，他建议筹建“汉字博物馆”的本意是“……为世界提供一处开放式的汉语教学基地，为子孙后代（每年都有二千多万孩子入学）做一件实实在在的事”。笔者只担心：这个设想中的“博物馆”的“设计平台”如何选对选准？如何用正确的汉字科学知识去教给下一代，而不是用胡说八道的伪科学去以讹传讹，误人子弟？这是必须慎之又慎的事。","price":"58.00元"},"book_id":"1078684","id":35},{"status":"read","rating":{"max":5,"value":"5","min":0},"updated":"2005-06-12
